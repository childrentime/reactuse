# useNetwork

Tracks the state of browser's network connection.

As of the standard it is not guaranteed that browser connected to the Internet, it only guarantees the network connection.

## Usage

```tsx
import { useNetwork } from "@reactuses/core";

const Demo = () => {
  const state = useNetwork();

  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(state, null, 2)}</pre>;
};
```

## Type Declarations

```ts
export interface INetworkInformation extends EventTarget {
  readonly downlink: number;
  readonly downlinkMax: number;
  readonly effectiveType: "slow-2g" | "2g" | "3g" | "4g";
  readonly rtt: number;
  readonly saveData: boolean;
  readonly type:
  | "bluetooth"
  | "cellular"
  | "ethernet"
  | "none"
  | "wifi"
  | "wimax"
  | "other"
  | "unknown";

  onChange: (event: Event) => void;
}

   * @desc Whether browser connected to the network or not.

   * @desc Previous value of `online` property. Helps to identify if browser
   * just connected or lost connection.
