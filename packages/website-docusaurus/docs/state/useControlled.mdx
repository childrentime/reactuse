# useControlled

`useControlled` is a custom hook that helps you manage controlled components. It is a wrapper around `useState` that allows you to control the value of a component from the outside.

:::note
The `useControlled` component does not support switching between controlled and uncontrolled modes, nor does it support passing a function for state updates. You can refer to this discussion for more information: https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/issues/2320.

## Usage

```tsx live
function Demo() {
  const [state, setState] = useState<string>("");
  const [value, setValue] = useControlled(state, "");
  const [value1, setValue1] = useControlled(undefined, "unControlled value");

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setState(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleChange1 = (event) => {
    setValue1(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
      <p>Controlled Value: {value}</p>
      <input value={value1} onChange={handleChange1} />
    </>
  );
}
```
