# use

`use` is a polyfill hook to resolve promises state for React v18 and below. Note that it only implements the ability to consume promises.
For React v19 and above, you can use the built-in `use` hook: https://react.dev/reference/react/use

## Usage

```tsx live noInline
const promise = new Promise((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("resolved");
  }, 5000);
});

function Demo() {
  const data = use(promise);

  return <p>{data}</p>;
};

render(
  <Suspense fallback="loading...">
    <Demo />
  </Suspense>
);

```
